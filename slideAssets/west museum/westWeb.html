                called Bombay, with the help of the government, to commemorate
                the visit of the Prince of Wales (later George V, king of the
                United Kingdom and emperor of India). It is located in the heart
                of South Mumbai near the Gateway of India. The museum was

                represents activities performed in daily village life. There
                were 12 Balutedars (essentially artisan castes), and 18
                Alutedars who provided equipment to carry out domestic and
                professional tasks.The museum is spread over 7 acres (28,000
                m2), and the surrounding countryside is beautiful, with lush
                greenery. Every aspect of village life has been depicted in
                almost 80 scenes that showcase more than 300 statues.

                The museum found its way into Vishalla three years after

                only museum of its kind in the world, displaying such a precious
                collection of utensils. A walk around the hut-like museum makes
                one's heart skip a beat, marveling at the inimitable beauty of
                these utensils of old. These utensils have been handed down
                through the changing seasons and times, over the years. They
                speak of the unmatched art and genius of humankind during the
                days of old when people did not have the modern facilities of
                our times. The designer could not let our rich heritage pass
                with these vessels being lost in the fire kilns! He was
                determined to preserve them, and today, his dream is a reality
                in the form of Vechaar.
