              <p>
                Dr SS Godbole, the first Anatomy Professor of Kasturba Medical
                College, had a passion for preservation. His techniques of
                careful dissection, processing and mounting of anatomical
                specimens are followed even today. It was under his watch that
                the museum opened its doors to the public in 1954, with over 650
                specimens from his own collection.Billed as one of the largest
                in Asia, the museum boasts of over 3,000 specimens and samples
                of things anatomical, including the skulls of an elephant and a
                whale, and the long skeleton of a King Cobra.

              <p>
                A nation whose dance and music tradition dates back to over
                2,000 years deserves this and more. There is, of course, the
                Sangeet Natak Academy, but it focuses more on performances —
                this was the thought that M R Jaishankar, the chairman of
                Brigade Group of Real Estate Developers, found himself thinking.
                But India needed something that also showcased the rich history
                of music, he realised while visiting the Grammy museum in Los
                Angeles. Roughly ten years later, his dream came true, and the
                IME was open to the public.
